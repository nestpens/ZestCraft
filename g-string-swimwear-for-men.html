            Confidence Begins Beneath the Surface
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The best swimwear isn’t just about showing skin—it’s about showing
            strength. That strength starts with support that amplifies presence,
            from ergonomic pouch designs to compression-ready structures that
            sculpt and define the waistline.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Here’s what makes the difference:

            <li>Ergonomic seams that follow natural movement</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This is more than design—it’s architecture for confidence.

            G-Strings, Trunks & Thongs: Why They Matter
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            From thongs to trunks—style for every body means more than just
            variety. It’s about validation, inclusion, and fashion that meets
            men where they are—whether that’s ripped and ready to pose, or soft,
            sensual, and self-assured.

              G-strings deliver minimal coverage with maximum effect. Ideal for

            <li>
              Swim trunks offer coverage with form-hugging appeal and come in

              Pouch-enhancing swim briefs balance sleek lines with anatomical
              engineering, supporting natural lift without compressing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thongs bring edge and eroticism, often favored for their visual
              confidence and minimal feel.

            Sexy swimwear for men isn’t about trying to impress—it’s about
